# Citation chaining

`Citation chaining` is a powerful search strategy that allows you to move backwards and forwards through a research topic.

When using `citation chaining`, you can find historic, current, and related research, and also identify how a topic has changed over time.

## Backward citation chaining

`Backward citation chaining` refers to using the reference list from a relevant source to discover additional related sources.
* When reading a source (article, book, etc.), make notes of cited sources related to your topic
* Find the sources in the reference list, footnotes, endnotes, etc.
* Find the full-text of the source
  * Journal article: Follow the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/1-journals.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> for searching in specific journals
  * Book/book chapter: Search the <a href ="https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?institution=UID&vid=UID&tab=ui_summit&search_scope=ui_alma_summit&indx=1&bulkSize=10&dym=true&highlight=true&displayField=all" target="_blank">library catalog </a>to see if we have access

## Forward citation chaining in Google Scholar
`Forward citation chaining` refers to identifying articles that have cited another article
